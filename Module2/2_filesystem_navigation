### Navigating File System

When navigating a UNIX filesystem, there are a few important commands:

- **cd**: Change directory. It is the primary command for moving around the filesystem.
- **pwd**: Print working directory. It tells you where your current location is.
- **ls**: List. It lists all the directories/files within a current working directory.

Using the TAB key to auto-complete can also be helpful.
